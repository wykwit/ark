Anti-rootkit Linux Kernel Module


## introduction

The goal of the project is to explore kernel security by implementing an anti-rootkit solution.
We will look at key kernel components (security-wise) and see how rootkits could abuse them.
Defense mechanisms such as AppArmor and SELinux are out of scope for this project.

Target for the final solution is kernel version >=4.0.
However, to demonstrate the basics first, we start off with older kernel versions and see how they've evolved.
Version 2.4 and 2.6 are described pretty well in the literature mentioned below.
They lack security features present in newer versions which makes our demonstations much easier.

If you're not sure what a rootkit is, go check Wikipedia.

## repository structure

We dig into the kernel in steps, each named after the concept explored in that part.
Steps consist of demonstrative "attack" and "defense" kernel modules.
The obvious assumption is that when we defend, we need the "defense" module to be loaded before the "attack" one.
Further explanations for each step should be given in proper README files.
